run npm init - to initialize a node js project in the backend folder
then we need to install some npm dependencies to make the nodejs server work
npm install express - http framework for running node servers
cors - so we can call the sever from anywhere else on the internet
axios - so we can make api calls to chat engine.io

npm install nodemon - which runs our sever in development mode
we need to get an extention Rest Client to send , cance/ and return http request
